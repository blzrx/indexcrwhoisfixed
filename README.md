# index.c rwhois fixed

Fixed version of the index.c file of the mkdb folder of the rwhois project, fixed to work on RHEL 3+

I put the file here so its easier to download it and fix the source code of the project, so you can compile it and the rwhois_index will work as expected.

Usage: 
1) Move to the mkdb folder of your uncompressed source code.
2) Issue the following command: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blzrx/indexcrwhoisfixed/master/index.c
3) Compile it as normal procedure.
